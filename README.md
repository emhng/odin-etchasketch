# TOP JavaScript Basics Foundations Project - Etch-A-Sketch
2021/12/10 ~ 2021/12/16

## Objectives

Using HTML, CSS, and Javascript build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

Must include:

- The sketchpad grid should be made using Javascript
- Be able to change the resolution of the sketchpad grid (from 16x16 up to 100x100)
- A way to clear the sketchpad

Optional features:

- Rainbow ink colour
- Ink colour that starts out at 10% opacity and gets darker upon passing over it


## Learnings

Used a lot of principles that I had used in the Rock Paper Scissors project.

Spent a lot of time resolving bugs that involved the drawing function - 
luckily a lot of the bugs were easily resolved by just changing what was being targeted or the order of the code

Continuing to find that checking how the site looks and functions in different browsers and screen sizes is important.
